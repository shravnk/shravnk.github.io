During my last semester of college, I enrolled in a course centered on philosophy in literature. My major's requirements prevented me from dabbling in liberal arts electives, so I was eager to finally have this opportunity. I got to know the professor fairly well over the ensuing months, and a few weeks before graduation we bumped into each other in the hallway. Among other things, he advised me to 'never stop learning'. It sounds fairly generic, but the gravity of his tone made a deep impression on me.

As college began to fade in the rearview mirror, this ideal of lifelong learning felt a little less romantic. The obligations of adult life don't leave much room for dedicated study and contemplation. I wanted to find a way to follow my professor's advice, but I also wanted somthing sustainable. In programming, I've found something which constantly challenges me to learn, but also affords It opportunity for a rewarding career.

Still, I've thought at times that I'm letting myself off the hook a bit. It's not as though mastering a new JavaScript library represents 'knowledge for the sake of knowledge'. There's a practical bent to almost everything you learn as a developer. This prompted me to recall my college experience once again.

It's an oft-recited cliche that the purpose of an undergraduate liberal arts degree is to teach you how to think. This sentiment pointedly excludes other fields of study like engineering or the hard sciences. Granted, the experience of a chemistry major is radically different than someone studying Victorian literature. I think it would be a mistake, however, to imagine a technical education as simply filling up toolbag with skills and knowledge to be applied in one's professional experience. An important part, maybe even *the* most important part, of a so-called practical education is *still* learning how to think. At least, I've found that to be the case while learning to write code for the past several months.

I'm excited to pursue a career which encourages continuous education. Many people don't have that sort of opportunity. For someone fortunate enought to be in this position, it's vital to nurture your own curiousity and be open to new ideas. Never stop learning.
